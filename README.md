Instructions 

The Foraging App is a simple application that allows users to track items they have foraged. The app has a simple domain model with Foragers and Items. Items have a name, category, and cost. Forages have the name of the Forager and a list of items they have foraged.

The app has a simple menu system that allows users to add items, add foragers, and add forages. The app also has reporting system that allows users to view reports of items foraged by date.

- Reports
    - Listed as Stretch Goals in Teachable, but you should complete at least 2 reports of your choice
    - What layer and class do these belong in?
    - How will you test them?
    - Can use streams or loops, or both in combination

- Actual stretch goals
    - After the 2 non-stretch reports, prioritize 1-2 CRUD stretch goals of your choice
    - Delete an Item / Delete a Forager are most challenging but most rewarding
