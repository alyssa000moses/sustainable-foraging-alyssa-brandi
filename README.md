Instructions 

- Make a README.md in the root of your project, and document all work you do in it
    - Think about documentation in terms of proving what you've done to the client
  
- Go through the working features and try to break them
    - Test each domain rule that applies (Requirements section in teachable)
        - Test suite
        - Manual QA
    - Fix any issues you find with the working features
    - Write tests that fail in the bugged state, and pass once you fix them

- Implement the incomplete features
    - Follow all Requirements
    - Test all method outcomes that you add to repos and domains

- Reports
    - Listed as Stretch Goals in Teachable, but you should complete at least 2 reports of your choice
    - What layer and class do these belong in?
    - How will you test them?
    - Can use streams or loops, or both in combination

- Actual stretch goals
    - After the 2 non-stretch reports, prioritize 1-2 CRUD stretch goals of your choice
    - Delete an Item / Delete a Forager are most challenging but most rewarding
